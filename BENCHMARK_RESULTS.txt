Benchmark Results for Phone Standardization Optimization

Methodology:
- Isolated DuckDB Node.js benchmark simulating 10,000 rows.
- 2,000 distinct mappings to apply.
- Compared "Batched UPDATEs" (current implementation) vs "JOIN UPDATE" (proposed optimization).

Results:
- Baseline (Batched UPDATEs): ~180ms - 200ms
- Optimization (JOIN UPDATE): ~20ms - 24ms
- Speedup: ~8x - 9x faster in pure DB execution time.

Additional Benefits:
- Reduces React state updates and re-renders from 10+ (N/200) to 1.
- Reduces `executeMutation` side effects (stat calculation, duplicate checks, session persistence) from 10+ to 1.
- Total end-to-end user perceived latency improvement is likely >10x due to removing repeated overheads.
Baseline (Sync localStorage): 32.16ms blocking
Improvement (Async localforage): ~80ms total, 0ms blocking
